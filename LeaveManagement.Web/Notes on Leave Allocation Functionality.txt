when creating a repositoty that needs to access the built in user functions, you can use dependancy injection to 
add the user manager to the repository:

 private readonly UserManager<Employee> userManager;

        public LeaveAllocationRepository(ApplicationDbContext context, UserManager<Employee> userManager): base(context)
        {
            this.userManager = userManager;
        }

so in addition to providing the dbContext, you are also injecting the user manager. 

This allows you to interact with the user DB in the different tasks of the repository - for example, getting all the users in a specific role:
 //get all employees in range so we can allocate them the leave:
var employees = await userManager.GetUsersInRoleAsync(Roles.User);
