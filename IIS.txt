C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc

that is the location of the hosts
after you add a website in the wwwroot:

C:\inetpub\wwwroot


in the drivers/etc go to "hosts" file
127.0.0.1 test.leavemanagement.com (in my case, that is the name i gave the host when i created the website on IIS Manager)

in IIS Manager, change the managed pools to No Managed Code for the pool associated with the site (it is in basic settings)
in MS SQL manager, go to the DB you want, to security, to logins, and add a new login (you are adding a user to have acceess); that will be 
"iis apppool\LeaveManagement"

then create the DB by simply right clicking on Databases and "Add new DB" named leavemanagementNet6 (from the connection string)

then you assign the login to the new database; you go to user mapping -> go to properties of the new user in the logins (right click ->properties)
user mapping -> mark leavemanagement DB and make sure to mark this user is the DB owner

in wwwroot folder (C:\inetpub\wwwroot\leavemanagement\EFSQLScripts) you can see the EF SQL scripts; open it up with Microsfot SQL manager, chagne the taret DB in the drop down (top left corner) to leavemanagementnet6 and excuete
